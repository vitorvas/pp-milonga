\section{Introduction}

Before any attempt to describe \textit{milonga} nuclear code in parallel, it is
necessary to describe its context and how it works. In order to do that, is mandatory
to give a brief introduction of \textit{wasora}.

Wasora is... \cite{wasora}.


Milonga makes extensive use of PETSc \cite{petsc} and SLEPc \cite{Hernandez2005} libraries and
its impossible to propose any parallelization scheme for milonga before devoting some
time to understand the way both of these libraries work.

Milonga also makes use of GNU Scientific Library \cite{gsl2016}. Although some efforts were made to make
GSL parallel capable \cite{Aliaga2004}, it has never reached a level of practical use. Considering
this fact and the plug-in structure of milonga - the reader must keep in mind that milonga runs
over wasora - there are several implementation details which can make the parallel implementation
of milonga more challenging. In the next section the authors try to bring some light over some
implementation details, the decisions made to achieve some degree of parallelization together with
explanations on the design basis of milonga.

%Considering
%this fact, a possible approach to make milonga parallel is to replace GSL functions used by
%discretization implementations in milonga by equivalent PETSc functions. Once milonga is ready to
%use PETSc data structures, the parallelization becomes more straighforward.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Design Basis and Code Structure}

%There is an elegant text explaining the development history of milonga \cite{Theler2014}. 

The design basis of milonga takes in account a wide range of aspects. 
In special, milonga focuses on four main development directions, namely:
the problems to be solved, the input of the problems, the 
output of solutions and the implementation. An elegant presentation 
of milonga's development history is presented by the code author 
German Theler \cite{Theler2014}. The brief comments on milonga's 
design basis is aimed to help to put in perspective the decisions 
made to parallelize milonga under the aspects of its initial development.
Better saying, understanding milonga's development 
axis significantly helps to understanding why, how and which parallelization techniques are used.

However, milonga runs on top of wasora and since both pieces of software 
are intrinsically connected, it is worth explaining the workflow of milonga 
execution as a plugin of wasora. First of all, wasora is responsible for 
arguments processing and input/output operations. In the set of I/O operations 
are mesh reading and processing, all of it performed by wasora. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Theory}

As said in the previous section, milonga makes use of PETSc and SLEPc to
build the matrices obtained from FEM or FVM formulations and then solve
them using the algorithms previously set. However, this is done sequentially.
In other words, only one processor is used to do the whole work. Considering
that multi-processor systems are the common computing platform today, one
way of making milonga faster is to split the matrices build and solve workload
among the available processors. How this can be done?

The \textit{de facto} method applied by the modern finite elements and
finite volumes software (like OpenFOAM \cite{OpenFOAM}) is to decompose
the calculation domain. The set of methods (which applies a number of
different algorithms for mesh partition) used for this purpose are
called, without surprises, domain decomposition methods.

In the present work, the idea is to use a slightly primitive approach at
the expense of not being an optimized solution and, at the same time,
being a lot simpler to implement. The idea behind this approach is not make
milonga faster than any other nuclear reactor calculation software.
Actually, this approach aims to evaluate the performance of a first
parallel implementation of milonga before going toward a more expensive
and time consuming implementation. A first simple parallel prototype can be
a valuable resource in order to predict the advantages and the odds of having
a more robust implementation which, on the other hand, can require a deep
re-factoring of FEM/FVM mesh related data structures.


\section{Profiling}
Before any attempt to parallelize any piece of software, a basic task must be performed:
software execution profiling. Profiling consists in a dynamic program analysis
that measures memory use, time complexity, number of function calls and many other characteristics of
a program.

The standard profiling tool for Linux systems is gprof [cite]. Gprof was used in a standard milonga
execution
%with a mesh of about 300 thousand elements
and fixed cross-sections in order to check
the existence of any bottlenecks of its execution.

\subsection{Test-Cases}

The profiling of milonga was performed in a set of different cases. The chosen geometry is one which is part of
milonga distribution files. It consists of a critical cylinder, with only one material and meshed with
tetrahedral elements. The same mesh is then used for four different simulations: two of based on
finite elements and two based on finite volumes discretization schemes. Each discretization scheme is used
to solve the neutron transport equation using the diffusion approximation and the discrete ordinates $S_N$ method,
making a total of four test-cases.

The mesh used has 680,000 tetrahedral elements.

\begin{table}[]

\caption{Meshes sizes}
\label{tab:sizes}

\toprule
                        &            & Tetrahedral & Hexahedrical \\ \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{small}  & N elements &               &              \\
                        & N nodes    &               &              \\
\multirow{2}{*}{medium} & N elements &               &              \\
                        & N nodes    &               &              \\
\multirow{2}{*}{big}    & N elements &               &              \\
                        & N nodes    &               &              \\ \cmidrule(l){2-4} 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

%The test case is made of two different meshes. These meshes are generated using the original cylinder geometry file
%provided by milonga as part of its examples/check cases. The first mesh is a tetrahedrical one and has $N$
%elements. The second mesh is generated using mainly hexahedra\footnote{Changes made into the original
%  geometry file are shown in \ref{Appendix}} and, despite having a different number of elements than
%the tetrahedrical mesh, keeps the number of elements at the same order of magnitude.

%For the selected mesh and finite volumes problem, two functions were clearly identified as bottlenecks:
%\begin{verbatim}
%kd_nearest_i
%hyperrect_dist_sq
%\end{verbatim}

%These functions belong to the third party code used to manipulate meshes. This chunk of code implements
%a \textit{k-d tree} structure and its associated algorithms. This data structure, proposed by \cite{Bentley1975}
%is aimed to partitioning a space and find neighobours of an element. Despite being the most used data
%structure for the proposed objective, it performes poorly for the needs of \textit{milonga}.

%The reason for this degraded performance is the ammount of data access necessary for finite volumes
%and finite elements discretization schemes. One solution for this bottleneck is to change the data structure
%in order to avoid the prohibitive number of neighbours searches. This can be accomplished storing neighbour
%information at each node or element. Of course, the drawback of this solution is the increase in the memory
%comsumption to store the data.

%\subsection{Examples: 3dshape cube}
%
%Some preliminary tests regarding a tethraedrical cube lead to the \texttt{mesh/tet4.c} file.
%Specifically, in function \texttt{mesh\_four\_node\_tetrahedron\_dhdr}, there is a long case
%statement which was replaced by a two if clauses function body, simply returning $-1$, $1$ or $0$
%depending on function arguments. These tests lead to an astonishing slow run of milonga (alcor-lx).



\subsection{Scalability}

One idea is to have a parametric simulation that would increase the number of mesh elements while checking the
memory consumption for each one. This could give a hint on how the memory increases relatively to the meshes sizes
serving as a potential source for optimization.

In order to assess how the performance of milonga degrades with the increase of the problem size, a \textit{benchmark}
test is proposed. This reference case is a modified version of the 2D PWR case provided with milonga \cite{Theler2014}
and consists of the same problem solved in three different discretizations, respectively increased. In other words,
the reference mesh was refined one time and the refined mesh was again refined. This process was carried by simply
using the \texttt{-refine} parameter of gmsh. \textbf{(ERRO na leitura. Mudar o .geo e o texto de acordo).}

The mesh sizes are presented in table ~\ref{tab:meshes}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{External libraries}

Milonga's development follows free and open source best practices in the sense of void re-inventing the wheel:
if there is a free and open software which offers functionalities need by milonga it must be considered to use.
Clearly, milonga makes use of some established open source software. One of them is the GNU Scientific Library, also
known as GSL \cite{gsl2016}, which provides routines for numerical computing with a standard API for C
programmers. Milonga heavily relies on mathematical, vector and matrices functions and data structures provided
by GSL.

But why speaking about external libraries since they are extensively used, tested and verified? Because
the parallelization of milonga using threads must take in account if external functions are
thread-safe\footnote{A thread-safe function is one function capable of correctly work during simultaneous
  execution by different threads.}. In the case of GSL as noted at the section 2.12 of its manual: "The library can be used in multi-threaded programs. All the functions are thread-safe, in the sense that they do not use static variables". Despite the affirmative the
simple fact of being considered thread-safe is not a guarantee of error free use. Special care must be taken to safely
distributed work in threads and details on how this is achieved in milonga parallel implementation will be provided
in the next sections.

\subsection{Matrices aimed to parallel solution [This has no effect in improving milonga performance]}
A simple approach to make milonga take advantage of parallel architectures is to parallelize the
solution of the linear system generated by the finite volumes of finite elements methods.

The computations are carried in two steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Matrix building;
  \item Matrix solution.
\end{enumerate}

milonga uses the PETSc library to perform both tasks. In order to be able to solve the linear problem
in parallel, a special care must be taken in the process of building the matrices.

\section{Parallelization}

There are two first approaches to parallelize milonga:
\begin{itemize}
\item Parallelize only the solution of the matrices obtained by the discretization
  provided by either finite volumes of finite elements discretization schemes using
  SLEPc and PETSc libraries;
\item Parallelize using domain decomposition techniques.
\end{itemize}

The chosen solution uses a mix of two different parallelization techniques. Based 
on milonga's code structure it is possible to use a thread based OpenMP approach to 
parallelize costly functions which does not have data dependency among loop variables. An example of this case is a mesh construction function were each element of the data structure inside a loop can be treated individually.

The other technique consists in taking advantage of PETSc and Slepc parallel 
capabilities to divide vector and matrices structures among different instances 
of the program.

In order to have such a mix of techniques working together, some design decisions 
must be made which also must define some constraints. They are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Only the rank zero program performs actions not related to PETSc or SLEPc 
libraries;
\item This program makes use of OpenMP to accelerate loop tasks;
\item\label{th:tres} Once milonga reaches the stage of building and solving the matrix problems, these tasks are parallelized accordingly to PETSc MPI constructs.
\end{enumerate}

The task \ref{th:tres} is not straightforward, though. Milonga relies on a neat 
implementation which uses pointers to functions to decide, in execution time, 
which discretization method will be used and which formulation will be used to solve the neutron equation.

So, once the text string containing this information is parsed, the corresponding 
functions are loaded in milonga's data structure. These functions are implemented 
in different files, accordingly to the formulation and discretizations available. 
These functions, on their turn, call petsc matrices and vectors allocation 
routines, located in other files. The clear advantage on this approach is the 
easy addition of new formulations and discretization methods, which must only 
follow the defined interface.

% Essa explicação abaixo está ruim: tem que deixar mais claro.
% Entretanto, só vai ficar claro depois que for implementada, pra ter certeza
% que será assim mesmo.
% milonga.c:65 -> diffusion_volumes.c:64 -> allocate.c:51
However, on its down side, the functions chain used to allocate PETSc related 
data makes the parallelization task more difficult since there are many parts 
of code which must be executed by parallel programs but should be called only 
once.

\subsection{Parallel Programming Patterns}
(James Reinders - Structure Parallel Programming presentation)
Parallel programming patterns where used to get communication between process after
domain decomposition but also to estimate the best decompositions considering the system
architecture. The partitions algorithm is parametrized, which allows fine tuning of performance
simply making parameters twinkling thus changing the memory occupancy/inter process communication ratio.



%Equations look exceedingly pretty. Here is a 3-D, monoenergetic, steady-state
%transport equation with isotropic scattering and an isotropic extraneous source:
%\begin{subequations} \label{eqs:fullTransport}
%\begin{multline} \label{eq:fullTransportVol}
%  \vec{\Omega}\vd \grad \psi(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega})
%  + \sigma(\vec{x}) \psi (\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega})
%\\ =
%  \frac{\sigma_s(\vec{x})}{4\pi} \int_{4\pi} \psi(\vec{x},\vec{\Omega}')
%  \ud\Omega' + \frac{q(\vec{x})}{4\pi}
%  \equiv \frac{1}{4\pi} Q(\vec{x}) \,,
%\end{multline}
%inside $\vec{x} \in V$, $\vec{\Omega} \in 4\pi$, with an incident boundary
%condition
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:fullTransportBndy}
%  \psi(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}) = \psi^b(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}) \,,
% \quad \vec{x} \in \partial V, \ \vec{\Omega} \vd \vec{n} < 0\,.
%\end{equation}
%\end{subequations}

\section{OpenMP}

The approach chosen for a first approach on \textit{milonga} parallelization
is to use threads on loops. This is one of the simplest forms of parallelization,
consisting in run segments of loops in different threads, taking care of memory
access and avoiding race conditions. The tool used for this task is OpenMP
\cite{Dagum1998}.

OpenMP is...

\appendix
\section{Appendix}
\label{Appendix}
Some changes were made to the original example \texttt{3dshape.mil} distributed
with milonga in order to create a similar mesh to the cylinder, but using
hexahedrical elements. The changes made in the \texttt{cylinder.geo} file
are listed below:

\begin{lstlisting}%[caption=Gmsh cylinder.geo example]
// Generate hexahedra
Recombine Surface {6};

Extrude {0, 0, 2*a} {
  Surface{6}; Layers{Round(2*a)}; Recombine;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Inside the \texttt{extrude} command, a \textit{layers} primitive is used to
define the number of layers to be extruded. The \textit{round} command must
be added to round the non-integer value previously defined. This is done
in order to keep a similar proportion to the tetrahedral mesh. The
command \textit{Recombine} is used to recombine tetrahedra into prisms,
hexahedra or pyramids, depending on the algorithm.
